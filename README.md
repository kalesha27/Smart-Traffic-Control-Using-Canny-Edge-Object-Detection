**# Density Based Smart Traffic Control System Using Canny Edge Detection**  

Team Project | Final Year Engineering | Role: Project Lead 
**#Technologies Used:**

MATLAB, Image Processing Toolbox, Canny Edge Detection, Morphological Operations, GUI 
## Description

• Developed a smart traffic control system using MATLAB that adjusts signal timing based on real-time 
vehicle density. 
• Implemented Canny Edge Detection and morphological operations to process and analyze traffic 
images. 
• Compared traffic images with a reference using statistical measures to determine density levels. 
## Outcomes 

• Improved traffic flow efficiency in simulations by dynamically adapting signal durations. 
• Gained hands-on experience in image processing, algorithm design, and team collaboration.
